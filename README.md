This is your README.md file where you can write your reflection response for this programming project.

REFLECTION:
What part of this lab was easiest and why?

The assistance of AI that Visual Studio Code provides has made this lab so much easier. It's almost like a second teacher. Utilizing the AI to construct the code for the lab allows us to better understand the individual segments of our code, as we may have to fix the code to comply to any additional data(allowing us to still be in charge).
